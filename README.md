# game
A terminal (ncurses) based game using Perlin noise maps, and characters in a harsh realm where the only way to survive is together.

This is something I started writing as a way of studying C++.  It has a C++ 11 implementation of perlin noise.  In the future it will get random numbers from random.org.  Best ran with a terminal using the square.ttf font installed, found in the "other" directory.
